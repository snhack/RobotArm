RobotArm
========

Code and files for driving servo robot arms.

So far, just hacked the example from 3dconnexion to make the space mouse controller move a fairly arbitrary selection of servos.  The code is a mess and needs some serious rework to make it useful.

Planned updates/fixes/changes:
		Fix height detection as it's buggy
		Add a timeout feature so arm resets if left unmoved
